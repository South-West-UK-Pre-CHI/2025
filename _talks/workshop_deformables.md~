Soft Interfaces—which are composed wholly or partially of malleable materials and typically utilise material centric 
approaches—support interactions that are difficult or impossible to achieve with rigid, articulated systems. Their deformability 
enables users’ greater freedom in how they engage with them, opening novel interaction possibilities across a wide range 
of application domains. This workshop invites participants to explore the field of soft interfaces—considering their 
unique properties, potential applications, and inherent limitations. We aim to identify key technical challenges and 
discuss future directions for research and development, drawing on insights from a range of disciplines.
