The term interdependence -- a state where two or more entities are in mutual dependence -- is a useful concept for various
aspects of HCI, such as accessibility and sustainability. However, more work is needed to parse out how technologies can
practically be designed to positively support interdependencies. With this workshop, we seek to synthesize our understanding
of interdependence as a concept. Together, we will explore how metaphors can be used to design for interdependence.
We will use the urban park setting as a source for inspiration and a place for co-creation of design metaphors for
interdependent relations. By inviting participants to explore their relationships with nature and the interdependent systems
in nature, we hope to build a basis for imagining technologies built for interdependent relationships.

Maximum 15 participants. First come, first served.
