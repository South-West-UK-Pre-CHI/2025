Academia is primarily structured around neurotypical norms, posing significant challenges for neurodivergent academics,
who often face additional barriers that hinder their success. This Special Interest Group (SIG) examines the experiences
of neurodiverse researchers in Human-Computer Interaction and explores how HCI can contribute to more inclusive academic
environments. By bringing together HCI researchers, neurodiverse academics, and allies, this SIG aims to develop strategies
for a more neurodivergent-inclusive, affirming, and supportive academic landscape. Since enhanced well-being can boost productivity,
addressing these challenges may unlock greater research output and contributions, particularly by harnessing the talent and creativity
of neurodivergent individuals. We will focus on challenges faced across career stages and roles (from students to senior academics,
research to teaching staff), and explore the role of technology in academia â€” assessing how it alleviates and exacerbates barriers.
Additionally, we aim to critically examine how policies and governance within the HCI community impact neurodiversity inclusion.
