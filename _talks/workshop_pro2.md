The pro² network+ are offering a hands-on workshop focussed on the areas of manufacturing, design and implementation 
that are often overlooked in low-volume device production, but can present the most significant challenges. Join us for 
a collaborative session where you can creatively explore elements of device design while learning the basics of ‘isotyping’
, or the process of creating prototype copies known as ‘isotypes’ for testing and refinement purposes. Open to all, 
we welcome you to take part in this exploration of real-world challenges and solutions faced by producers of devices 
when transitioning from prototype to product.
