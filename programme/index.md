section_content="Monday will begin with a registration period, starting at TBC for DC members and TBC for everyone else, where you will arrive at the building and receive your name badge that we have created for you. Please bring your own lanyard for the badge as we will not be providing one. If you are arriving for the first time on the Tuesday, please wait at reception when you arrive to collect your badge. We request that you keep your name badge on you at all times so that we know you are a member of the event as WMB is a secure building. The event will begin with a short welcome talk, and then different talk sessions that will last an hour, with each paper presenting for roughly 10 minutes, and then a 5-minute Q&A after each presentation. Questions asked by audience members will be repeated by the chair for clarity. After each session, a 20-minute break will occur where refreshments will be served in The Great Hall. We are currently expecting the conference will follow the following format Monday: Coffee (no biscuits), DC, Lunch, Talk 1, Coffee (biscuits), Talk 2 Tuesday: Coffee (no biscuits), Talk 3, Coffee (biscuits!), Talk 4, Lunch + Town Hall, Workshops + Demos."

section_content="Hearing loops will be in place for the duration of the conference. Visual guides will be available for those who requested them on the registration form. Copies of the slides with alt-text are available on the Google Drive so that anyone can have a closer look or use a screen reader to view the slides. We politely ask attendees not to share any of the content of the Google Drive, or download the slides if not necessary as they are not for public distribution. Live Captioning will be provided at every panel session and presentation." %}
